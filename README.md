This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is an workshop for CSS study ([github repo](https://github.com/css-for-js/sole-and-ankle)), for the Module 4 in [CSS for JS developers course](https://css-for-js.dev/) by [Josh W Comeau](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau)
